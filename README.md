# jobseekers

add your name to be tagged in linkedin posts with junior job postings!

---

(Still working out how to make this easy for people on linkedin, copy/paste does not tag people and I know how big this list is going to get)

---

### How to get on the list:

Make a PR on this README file, add your name exactly how you would be tagged on LinkedIn.

PUT YOUR NAME ON THE NEXT NEW LINE IN THE EDITOR PLEASE

For example, I would add mine as

@Andrew Clarkson

If you have an emoji, make sure it is there.

If you see your name in a job post but you aren't tagged properly, come back, make a PR and fix it.

If you get a job you were tagged on, come back and add a section for I GOT THE JOB and put your name in it!

I'll approve PRs every few days so there may be a bit of time between a PR and you being on the list.
